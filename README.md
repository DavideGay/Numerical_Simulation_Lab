# NSL - Davide Gay

## Overview
This repository contains all exercises assigned during the course of Numerical Simulation Laboratory.

In each directory is a Jupyter Notebook which contains a concise explanation of the topic and , more importantly, how the problems were tackled, graphs presenting the simulation results and comments on those results.

Most of the simulation task for the exercises has been handled with C++ codes. In almost all cases, the source code is located inside the exercise directory or an appropriate subdirectory. Excetions are exercises 4, 6 and 7 which use the NSL_SIMULATOR code, which is provided in a separate directory.

Instructions on how to compile and run the codes are present inside each directory.
